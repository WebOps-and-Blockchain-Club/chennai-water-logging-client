      content="This platform enables users / public to report details such as flood location and water depth, as well as add photos of flood sites with a description across the Chennai region as frequently as possible. All reports are gathered onto a real-time flood map. The data gathered through this platform aims to improve disaster preparedness and response in communities by gathering, sorting, and presenting data of flooding reports.

                This Crowd source data, curated through this platform will help to understand the reasons for waterlogging / inundation and help IIT Madras researchers to develop / design remedial measures that may be recommended to GCC, PWD and other relevant Govt. departments for their action."

      Notice the use of %PUBLIC_URL% in the tags above.
      It will be replaced with the URL of the `public` folder during the build.
      Only files inside the `public` folder can be referenced from the HTML.

      Unlike "/favicon.ico" or "favicon.ico", "%PUBLIC_URL%/favicon.ico" will
      work correctly both with client-side routing and a non-root public URL.
      Learn how to configure a non-root public URL by running `npm run build`.
